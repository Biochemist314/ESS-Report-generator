# ESS-Report-generator
Python code that should be run on isca. It takes in a file with lists of folder and generates a tex file that can be compiled in latex with the correct format and appropriate section based on Exeter Sequencing Service (ESS) folder delivery format. Currently the format is for Illumina runs only but Nanopore runs report will come soon.
